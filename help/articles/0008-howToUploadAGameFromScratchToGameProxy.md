If you would like to upload your Scratch project to GameProxy, you can copy the link, paste it into 'Game File URL' in the Upload section, add the title, leave the thumbnail blank (we will get that for you from the Scratch database) and then write a descriptive description. If you click Upload a single time (if you press it multiple times it may create duplicates) and wait a few seconds, you should be on the homepage. If you search for your game and click on it, you should see your game. If the game isn't verified, it means it has not been checked yet, but once it has that symbol it means that we have checked it. You can toggle between Flash and Non-Flash and it should work fine. You have just sucessfully uploaded your first Scratch game!
