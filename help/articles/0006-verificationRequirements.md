If you would like to have your game verified on GameProxy which means more likes, follows and views, these are the following requirements your game has to meet:

* No Inappropriate material
* No extremely violent material
* No rude words
* No offencive material

If your game passes all of these requirements, your game should be verified very soon. If not, it will be promptly removed from GameProxy.
