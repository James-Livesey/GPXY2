Hello, and welcome back to another GameProxy help article. Today, I'm going to explain how to upload games to GameProxy, right from when you have the file. If you would like to know what files you can upload to GameProxy, you can read this helpful article [here](https://gameproxy.github.io/help/index.html?article=0001-supportedFileTypes.md).

If you go to the homepage of GameProxy and click on Account [here](https://gameproxy.github.io/account.html) or at the top of this page, you should be able to see an upload game box. If you add the name of your game, you can continue to the next step.

## Part 1: Game File Link

Firstly you need to get the game file link. If you do not already have the game file link online but only have it locally stored, you can choose from one of the following upload options:

* GitHub Repository

Once you have chose your option, you can scroll down the page until you find it.

If you have already got the game file link online though, you can add it to the box 'Game File URL' and skip to 'Part 2: Game Thumbnail'.

## Upload using a GitHub Repository

If you would like, you can upload a game from a repository on your GitHub.

Firstly, if you sign into GitHub, click on the Plus icon and then New Repository. 

You should now see a page with the heading 'Create a new repository. If you are not familiar with GitHub, a repository is a place where you can store files for your project or, in this case, your GameProxy uploads. If you enter GameProxy-gameFiles or something similar as your Repository name, leave the description box empty and make sure the repository is set to Public as this is needed later, you can click 'Create repository'.

After this, you should see a screen like below.

Underneath the text saying Quick Setup, you can click 'uploading an existing file'. If you upload your files, leave the text boxes blank and click 'Commit'.
